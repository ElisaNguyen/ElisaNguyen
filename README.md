### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ & nice to meet you!

I'm Elisa, currently a second-year master student in Interaction Technology at the University of Twente. I am passionate about learning, cultural exchange and the intersection between technology and society.

Recently, I have started my thesis research about explainability methods for spiking neural networks.

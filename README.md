### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ & nice to meet you!

I'm Elisa, a recent graduate from the Interaction Technology program at the University of Twente. 

My Master research about explainability in spiking neural networks is in my pinned repository tsa-explanations. 

Feel free to check out my other pinned repositories as well, which are mainly university projects in the field of machine learning and NLP.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ & nice to meet you!

I'm Elisa, a first-year PhD student in the Scalable Trustworthy AI group at the University of TÃ¼bingen. 

Recently, I graduated from the Interaction Technology program at the University of Twente. 
My Master research about explainability in spiking neural networks is in my pinned repository <i>tsa-explanations</i>. 
**ElisaNguyen/ElisaNguyen** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

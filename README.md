Hi there ðŸ‘‹ & nice to meet you!

I'm Elisa, a PhD student in the [Scalable Trustworthy AI group](https://scalabletrustworthyai.github.io) at the University of TÃ¼bingen. I'm interested in researching how technology can benefit humans and society, in particular the field of responsible and trustworthy AI.

Recently, I graduated from the Interaction Technology program at the University of Twente. 
My Master research about explainability in spiking neural networks is in my pinned repository <i>tsa-explanations</i>. 
**ElisaNguyen/ElisaNguyen** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
